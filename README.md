## Overview

This project serves as the backend for an e-commerce platform, handling various operations related to products, orders, customers, and more. It provides a RESTful API for frontend applications to interact with the backend services.

## Technologies Used

- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot): A powerful and opinionated framework for building Java applications.
- [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework): The core of the Spring ecosystem, providing support for various enterprise application features.
- [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/): An ORM framework that simplifies database interactions by mapping Java objects to database tables.
- [JPA (Java Persistence API) Repository](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/persistence-jsp.html): A standard Java specification for ORM that provides a high-level API for working with relational databases.
- [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/): A tool for documenting and testing APIs, providing a user-friendly web interface.
- [MySQL Database](https://www.mysql.com/): An open-source relational database management system, providing robust performance and scalability.
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/): A popular API testing tool for debugging and testing API endpoints.
