## Overview

 This project is an e-commerce backend application built using Java, Spring Boot, SQL database with JPA and Hibernate. It includes API endpoints for managing products, orders, customers, and more. You use Postman for API testing and Swagger for API documentation. Additionally, the project sends auto-generated emails for various events such as order confirmation or updates.

## Technologies Used

- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot): A powerful and opinionated framework for building Java applications.
- [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework): The core of the Spring ecosystem, providing support for various enterprise application features.
- [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/): An ORM framework that simplifies database interactions by mapping Java objects to database tables.
- [JPA (Java Persistence API) Repository](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/persistence-jsp.html): A standard Java specification for ORM that provides a high-level API for working with relational databases.
- [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/): A tool for documenting and testing APIs, providing a user-friendly web interface.
- [MySQL Database](https://www.mysql.com/): An open-source relational database management system, providing robust performance and scalability.
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/): A popular API testing tool for debugging and testing API endpoints.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/e-commerce-backend.git`
2. Set up the MySQL database and configure the database connection in `application.properties`.
3. Build the project: `mvn clean install`
4. Run the application: `mvn spring-boot:run`

## Features
# 1. User Management(this is under proccess)
User Registration: Allow users to create an account with the platform by providing necessary information like username, email, and password.
User Login and Authentication: Implement a secure login system using tokens or session management to authenticate users and protect sensitive data.
Password Reset: Provide a mechanism for users to reset their passwords if they forget them.
# 2. Product Management
Create Products: Allow authorized users to add new products to the platform, including details such as name, description, price, quantity, and images.
Retrieve Products: Enable users to browse and search for products, and view details about each product.
Update and Delete Products: Allow authorized users to modify existing product information or remove products from the platform.
# 3. Order Management
Create Orders: Enable users to place orders by selecting products and specifying quantities. Record relevant order details like customer information, payment status, and shipping information.
Process Payments: Integrate with payment gateways to handle secure online payments for placed orders.
Manage Order Status: Allow order status updates (e.g., processing, shipped, delivered) to keep users informed about the progress of their orders.
# 4. Customer Management
Customer Information: Store and manage customer data, including personal details and order history.
Order History: Provide customers with a view of their past orders and associated details.
# 5. Cart Management
Add to Cart: Allow users to add products to their shopping cart, even if they are not ready to proceed with the purchase immediately.
Remove from Cart: Enable users to remove products from the cart before completing the purchase.
Calculate Totals: Automatically calculate the total price and quantity of items in the cart.
# 6. API Documentation
Swagger Documentation: Generate comprehensive API documentation using Swagger, providing clear details about all available endpoints, request parameters, and response formats.
# 7. Auto-Generated Emails
Order Confirmation: Send an automated email to customers upon successfully placing an order, confirming their purchase and providing relevant order details.
Order Updates: Notify customers via email about any changes in the order status (e.g., processing, shipping, delivery).
# 8. Security and Authentication(this is under proccess)
Implement proper security measures to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access to API endpoints.
Use industry-standard practices for authentication and authorization, such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth.
# 9. Error Handling and Validation
Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle any unexpected errors that may occur during API calls.
Perform input validation to ensure that the data received from clients is correct and meets the required criteria.
# 10. Testing
Postman Testing: Conduct thorough testing of the API endpoints using Postman to ensure their correct functionality and responses.

## API Documentation

The API endpoints are well-documented using Swagger UI. After running the application, you can access the API documentation at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`. Use this documentation to understand the available endpoints and interact with the API for testing.
